                <p> This visualization was a way to explore common motifs within fairy tales and compare their popularity within the library of provided stories. One initial difficulty I had with this assignment was that
                    I was not familiar with any text analysis techniques, so my initial research focused on learning what options were available and the basics of their implentation. I ended up working with LDA modeling,
                    which is an algorithm that predicts the likelihood of topics being present in a piece based on a training set. I trained my LDA model on 211 other fairy tales in the public domain, from sources such as 
                    Grim's Fairytales, Hans Christian Andersen's stories, and traditional fairy tales from Japan.  
                </p>
                <p> Though I wasn't initially sure how I wanted to visualize the data, one feature I kept in mind as I began sketching was the ability to compare the common themes in one story to the rest of them.
                    I considered a bar graph that showed the mean probability of a theme appearing in the text, but I thought the mean gave an insufficient picture of the data that only showing all the storys' data could provide.
                    Next, I considered having a series of line graphs that behaved in a similar way to my radar graph (displaying all the graphs on one plane to see the commonality of themes). As I researched other uses of this kind of graph,
                    I opted against it as I saw that these line graphs tended to have significantly more than five points along their lines and usually were denoting something that had to do with time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used <a href="https://gist.github.com/nbremer/6506614">this library</a> to create my base visualization, which I then revised to support version 6 of d3 and create a simpler and more legible display of the story set.
                    I found it difficult to significantly deviate from this library, which I thought made the connnection of the visualization to the texts unclear at first. One design decision that came through in this final
                    sketch and implementation was the choice to move the sidebar to the left side from the right. I think this shift allows the sidebar to be read before the graph, which allows it to be a primer to what the graph is 
                    doing. On a longer-term project, I would have loved to watch others use my site to see if this interaction could be improved by incorporating the selection color on the graph elsewhere, such as the bolded title or in the sidebar.
