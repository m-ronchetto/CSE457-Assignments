                    This visualization is transparent in its methodology, prominently displaying the research question posed to participants and information 
                    about who responded to the poll. In addition to being a simple and legible bar graph, the title of the visualization shares a top level 
                    hierarchy on what was learned through this survey.

                    This visualization is difficult to read because of the textures on the pie chart segments and the low contrast between the images and text. 
                    It is unclear which percentages correspond with each portion of the pie, and the possible responses overlap with each other (students could say "yes" or "I have" to the survey question).

                    This visualization improves on the previous by improving the contrast and readability of the percentages on the pie chart. 
                    The similar responses have been combined for clarity, and are labeled more directly on the chart.
